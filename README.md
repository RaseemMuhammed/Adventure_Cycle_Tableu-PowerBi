# Adventure_Cycle_Tableu-PowerBi
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of Adventure Cycle Sales Data using two powerful business intelligence tools: Power BI and Tableau.By leveraging these tools, the project aims to offer stakeholders actionable insights that can help optimize sales strategies, improve inventory management, and identify potential growth areas.
Key Components:
Data Sources: The project pulls data from multiple sources such as sales transactions, customer demographics, product catalog, and regional sales performance.

Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Both Power BI and Tableau are used to clean and transform raw data to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis.
Key metrics such as total sales, average cycle prices, units sold, and customer segments are calculated.
Visualizations:

Power BI: Interactive dashboards are created to track the key performance indicators (KPIs), including total sales by region, cycle type, and customer demographics. Power BI's integration with other Microsoft tools allows for deeper insights into sales forecasts, trends, and financial analysis.
Tableau: Tableau is used to create sophisticated visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, and geographical maps to explore sales patterns, product performance, and regional distribution.
